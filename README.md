# Performance-Analysis-in-Grand-Slams-and-ATP-Rankings

The purpose of this project is to develop a data management system focused on the world of professional
tennis, with a focus on Grand Slam tournaments over the past decade. The main objective is to acquire,
store and integrate data from different sources to analyze the performance of young tennis players.
The data were acquired through web scraping techniques from up-to-date authoritative sources.
The acquired data were structured and stored in a MongoDB database, chosen for its flexibility in
handling semi-structured and unstructured data.
This data management project provides a robust and scalable platform for collecting, storing, and
analyzing tennis data, with an emphasis on the performance of young tennis players. The integrated,
structured approach facilitates in-depth analyses and enables meaningful insights that can influence
strategic decisions in the world of professional tennis.
